INSTRUCTIONS TO BEAT THE GAME:
    When the game starts, you spawn in an area called Main Base. Here you have access to the levels, the shop and NPCs. 

    At the beginning, you only have access to the first level (level 0) which is the door on the left. This door is unlocked from the very beginning. To enter the level, stand in front of the door and press the W key. This takes you to the Level 0. 

    You must beat level 0 three times to unlock level 1.

    There is a counter on every door that displays 3 dots. These dots will be either green or red. The dots are initially red. The door will unlock when all three dots are green. Every time you beat the current level, one red dot will turn green until all three dots are green. 

    When the portal to level 1 is unlocked (all dots are green), you can interact with it using the W key to enter level 1.

    You must beat level 1 three times to unlock level 2.

    You must beat level 2 three times to unlock the final level “Beanos”.

    To win the game you have to beat level Beanos.

HOW TO BEAT A LEVEL:
    When you enter a level, you find yourself inside a dungeon that has multiple rooms. You will find pickable items, like weapons, inside the rooms. Use W key to pick up weapons. You will also enemies in these rooms. They will try to kill you, so you have to kill them before they do. An example of an enemy is a turret. Turrets can fire arrows in UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT directions. If an arrow hits you, your HP will decrease. If your HP reaches 0, you die and respawn in the main base. To kill an enemy you can hit it with melee damage, an arrow (if you have a bow), or a fireball (if you have a staff). This will decrease the enemies health, and when it reaches 0, the enemy dies and drops a coin. You can pick up coins by standing over them. When you enter certain rooms, you will have to complete a mission to open the doors to the next rooms. This mission could be to pick up an item, or to kill all the enemies in the room. If you keep exploring the dungeon you will find a key. This key is used to unlock the boss room. Once you have the key you can open the locked door with W key. Then you will enter the boss room. Once you beat this room, you have beat the level and you will spawn in the main base.

HOW TO INCREASE YOUR DAMAGE AND HEALTH:
    In the main base there are two houses. The house on the left is the SHOP. If you enter the shop (by pressing W key when standing in front of the door) you can interact with the two VENDORS: TOTA increases your maximum health, ALEJANDRO increases your damage. Both of these services cost 5 coins each. To interact with them you have to walk up to them and press W key. They will talk to you. To continue with the dialogue press W key again. Then they will offer you their services, to accept press W key. To reject press X key. 

BEANOS DUNGEON LORE:
    The people from the village lived a happy life until the terrible Beanos arrived, with his purple body and unfazed look in his eyes. He caused terror in the village until they managed to lock him up in a dungeon. Now they need someone to finish Beanos off and finally bring peace to the village.
